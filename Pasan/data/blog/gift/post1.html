    There are different kinds of love, and they are beautiful in their own special ways. With Lassana Flora, celebrate all kinds of love that make your life beautiful and complete.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and St. Valentine’s Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. People think it’s a day to celebrate romantic relationships alone, but it is a day to celebrate love. Love for your husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, mother, sister, cousin, grandmother, friend, teacher, someone who inspires you, someone you must thank, and even for someone just because.&nbsp;</p>
